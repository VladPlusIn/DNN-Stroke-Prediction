## Project Workflow

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Data Overview**: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Missing Value Analysis**: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization**: Generate plots to explore the relationships between features and the target variable.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between features to identify important predictors.

### Deep Neural Network (DNN) Model

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Building**: Define the architecture of the DNN, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.
3. **Model Training**: Train the DNN model using the training dataset and validate its performance on the validation set.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Results and Insights

The project includes detailed results and insights:
- Visualization of the data distribution and relationships between features.
